# Templates

Starter files for setting up any AI coding agent. Use the [adopt prompt](../adopt.md) to have your agent scaffold these automatically, or grab them manually if you prefer.

## Quick adoption

1. Copy `project-file.md` → rename for your tool (see table below)
2. Have your agent derive project identity, constraints, architecture, and "Before You Start" pointers from your codebase — then review and adjust what only you know
3. Copy `gotcha-log.md` → save in your memory/docs directory
4. First session: let the self-learning loop start naturally — log gotchas as you hit them, agent curates at end-of-session

If your tool has auto-memory (currently Claude Code), also grab `memory-index.md`. If your project has deployment or operational complexity, grab `RUNBOOK.md`.

**Tools without auto-memory**: The project file carries more weight — it's your only auto-loaded file. Keep it lean, use it as an index with task-triggered pointers to the runbook, gotcha log, and ADRs. The self-learning loop still works; promotion just targets the project file directly instead of passing through a memory index.

**Multi-tool teams**: Maintain one canonical project file, symlink or copy to tool-specific locations. The content is the same — only the filename differs.

## The files

- **[`project-file.md`](project-file.md)** — Project identity, constraints, architecture, and "Before You Start" table
- **[`memory-index.md`](memory-index.md)** — Auto-loaded index + current state (for tools with auto-memory)
- **[`gotcha-log.md`](gotcha-log.md)** — Structured problem/solution journal with promotion tracking
- **[`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md)** — Operational principles and how-to
- **[`review-agent.md`](review-agent.md)** — Reusable skeleton for domain review agents (code review, rubric design, assessment audit, etc.) with self-learning capability
- **[`curate.md`](curate.md)** — End-of-session curation skill that automates the self-learning loop (gotcha review, pattern promotion, memory index update). For Claude Code, save as `.claude/skills/curate/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (see template comments) to get a `/curate` skill; for other tools, use as an end-of-session prompt
- **[`audit-context.md`](audit-context.md)** — Periodic structural audit of the layered memory system (duplication, wrong-layer placement, bloat, broken references, gitignore correctness). For Claude Code, save as `.claude/skills/audit-context/SKILL.md` for a `/audit-context` skill; for other tools, run as an ad-hoc prompt monthly or after major restructuring
- **[`adr.md`](adr.md)** — Architecture Decision Record template with options matrix, consequences, and "Revisit If" triggers. Save each decision as `docs/decisions/ADR-NNN-short-slug.md` and keep an index in `docs/decisions/README.md`
- **[`checklists/`](checklists/)** — Validation checklists for each workflow stage: [architect](checklists/architect-checklist.md), [test](checklists/test-checklist.md), [implement](checklists/implement-checklist.md), [qa](checklists/qa-checklist.md). Lightweight definition-of-done gates (10-15 items each)
