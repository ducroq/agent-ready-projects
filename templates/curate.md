# Curate

<!-- SAVE AS: .claude/skills/curate/SKILL.md (Claude Code)
     For other tools, run this as an end-of-session prompt manually.

     This is a skill (/curate) that automates the end-of-session
     curation step of the self-learning loop. Instead of manually reviewing
     the gotcha log and memory index, the agent does the heavy lifting
     and you review its proposals.

     Claude Code skills require SKILL.md as the entry point inside a
     named directory under .claude/skills/. Add frontmatter:
     ---
     name: curate
     description: End-of-session curation — review gotcha log, promote patterns, update memory index
     disable-model-invocation: true
     --- -->

End-of-session curation for the agent-ready-projects framework.

Review the session's work and update the layered memory system:

## Step 0 — Freshness check

Check for context rot from *previous* sessions. This catches what the session-focused steps below miss.

1. **Dead references**: Read the memory index and project file. For every file path mentioned, verify it still exists. List any broken paths.
2. **Stale memory**: Check modification dates of files in `memory/`. Flag any that haven't been modified in 30+ days — they may be outdated. (Use `git log -1 --format=%ci -- <file>` for each.)
3. **Lingering gotchas**: Read the gotcha log. Flag any unresolved entries older than 14 days — they're either fixed (mark `[RESOLVED]`) or stuck (surface to the user).
4. **Ground truth drift**: If the project file has a "Ground Truth Designations" table, verify each listed file exists and has been modified more recently than the artifacts that defer to it. Flag any where a downstream artifact is newer than its source of truth.

Report findings before proceeding. Don't fix anything in this step — just surface what's stale so the engineer can decide.

## Step 1 — Gotcha log review

Read `memory/gotcha-log.md` (or `docs/gotcha-log.md` if not using Claude Code). For each existing entry:
- If the root cause was fixed during this session, mark it `[RESOLVED]`
- If the same issue came up again, note the recurrence

Then check: did anything go wrong or surprise you during this session? For each one, append a new entry:

```
### [Short description] (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Problem**: What went wrong or was confusing.
**Root cause**: Why it happened.
**Fix**: What solved it.
```

## Step 2 — Pattern detection and promotion

Scan the gotcha log for entries that have recurred 2-3 times. For each:
- Propose promoting it as an "if [situation], then [what to do]" pattern
- Suggest where it belongs: the memory index (if broadly relevant) or a topic file (if subsystem-specific)
- If approved, add it to the destination and update the Promoted table in the gotcha log

## Step 3 — Memory index update

Read the memory index (`MEMORY.md` for Claude Code, or the project file for other tools). Update:
- **Current State** — reflect what shipped or changed this session
- **Key File Paths** — add any important files discovered during work
- **Active Decisions** — add any architectural choices made, with ADR pointers if created
- Remove or correct anything that is now stale

## Step 4 — Verify references

Skip if Step 0 already ran a full freshness check. Otherwise, spot-check that paths mentioned in the memory index and project file still exist. Flag any broken references.

## Step 5 — Report

Summarize what you changed:
- **Freshness**: Dead references, stale memory files, lingering gotchas, ground truth drift (from Step 0)
- **Gotchas**: New entries added, entries resolved or promoted
- **Memory index**: Updates made
- **Action needed**: Anything flagged that requires engineer decision
