# Changelog

All notable changes to the agent-ready-projects framework. Adopters can check their project file's `agent-ready-projects` version against this log to see what's changed.

## v1.0.0 (2026-03-13)

First stable release.

### Framework
- Layered model: project file (L1), runbook (L2), memory index + topic files (L3), gotcha log (L4)
- Auto-loading cliff concept with task-triggered pointers
- Self-learning loop: Capture > Surface > Promote > Retire
- Processor memory hierarchy analogy (miss cost asymmetry, eviction discipline, locality of reference)
- Promotion and retirement patterns for knowledge lifecycle
- Decision records (ADRs) as companion practice
- Session hooks and session strategy guidance
- Documentation rhythm (capture during work, curate at end-of-session)

### Templates (tool-agnostic)
- `project-file.md` — project identity, constraints, "Before You Start" table
- `memory-index.md` — auto-loaded index with topic file pointers, recently promoted section
- `gotcha-log.md` — structured problem/solution journal with promotion tracking
- `RUNBOOK.md` — operational principles and how-to

### Adoption
- `adopt.md` — agent-facing prompts for assess, adopt, and update workflows
- `templates/README.md` — tool-naming map (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Aider)

### Documentation
- Tool-specific setup and concept mapping table
- Measuring success signals (working / failing)
- What doesn't work (anti-patterns)
- Landscape analysis, BMAD/spec-kit comparison, methodology docs
